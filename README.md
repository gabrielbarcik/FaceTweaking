## Requirements

Java 1.8
OpenCV 3.2

## Instructions

Add the desired image file as image.jpg to the project root, open a shell and run
```
$ bash RUN.sh
```

## Scalability: Implementing new features

To implement a new feature, it suffices to create a new folder in lib/features that contains YourClass.h/YourClass.cpp (inheriting from BaseFeature) and a 'media' directory with the .jpg images you will use during the morphing. You also need to adapt engine/main.cpp accordingly.
